# SRbanking

Currently, this project is a **terminal-based banking system** that allows users to:

- [x] Use an account

ðŸ”¹ **Backend & Database**  
- [ ] Integrate a **relational database** (MySQL/PostgreSQL) to store user and transaction details  
- [ ] Implement **user authentication** with password encryption (JWT/OAuth)  

ðŸ”¹ **Banking Features**  
- [ ] Add **transaction history tracking** for each account
